# CS142_HotJava
Group project for Prof. Elliot's Wi22 CS142 course.

Hello!
Welcome to our Group Project. We will be attempting to re-create a card game using Java. 
This repository is pretty empty at the moment, but here's a breakdown of what it does contain.

FOLDER_JDK-13: contains the reference code used in conjunction with https://greenteapress.com/thinkjava6/html/index.html

^Ch.12: self-explanatory

^Ch.13: self-explanatory 

FOLDER_Cardset-Oxymoron: folder containing face images, backings, as well as shadows for a 52-count card deck that is consistent with the naming convention used by the arrays in Chapters 12 and 13.
